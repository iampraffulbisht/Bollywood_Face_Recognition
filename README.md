This project implements a celebrity face recognition system using OpenCV and the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognizer. The system is tailored to detect and recognize faces of Bollywood celebrities within images. It begins by employing a cascade classifier for face detection, pinpointing facial regions based on predefined patterns. Once faces are detected, the system extracts these areas and applies the LBPH face recognizer to predict and classify each face against a database of known Bollywood celebrities.

This system not only identifies celebrities but also annotates them with labels corresponding to recognized individuals, providing a visual indication of who is present in the image. Such a tool finds practical use in media management, content recommendation systems, and celebrity event coverage, offering automated identification and tagging of well-known personalities. Adjustments to parameters like confidence thresholds and facial detection criteria optimize its accuracy across different images and scenarios.
